`pyinstaller --onefile --strip --exclude-module tkinter src/main.py`

I wanted to make this project so that i can experiment with various techniques and stuff relaated to chess engines. Then i may implement them in cpp for performance. I may continue on the python version to try to make it faster and better so that it can play a little decent.
